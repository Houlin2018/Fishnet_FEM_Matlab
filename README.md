### This is the matlab code that simulates the gradual failure of rectangular fishnet lattices with random link strengths.

It was used to generate millions of strength data for the histogram in the following publications:

1. Luo, Wen, and Zdeněk P. Bažant. "Fishnet model for failure probability tail of nacre-like imbricated lamellar materials." _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ 114, no. 49 (2017): 12900-12905.
2. Luo, Wen, and Zdeněk P. Bažant. "Fishnet statistics for probabilistic strength and scaling of nacreous imbricated lamellar materials." _Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids_ 109 (2017): 264-287.
3. Luo, Wen, and Zdeněk P. Bažant. "Fishnet model with order statistics for tail probability of failure of nacreous biomimetic materials with softening interlaminar links." _Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids_ 121 (2018): 281-295.

To run the code, use the file "**Fishnet_FEM_Softening_Batch_V2.m**" as the main function. 

Different random distributions of link strength can be used by calling various functions with name "**r_sig_XXX**".

The code itself is self-explanatory.
