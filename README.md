# Fishnet_FEM_Matlab
Fishnet Lattice Finite Element Code (in Matlab)

This is the matlab code used to simulate the gradual failure of rectangular fishnet lattices in the following publications:

1. Luo, Wen, and Zdeněk P. Bažant. "Fishnet model for failure probability tail of nacre-like imbricated lamellar materials." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 114, no. 49 (2017): 12900-12905.
2. Luo, Wen, and Zdeněk P. Bažant. "Fishnet statistics for probabilistic strength and scaling of nacreous imbricated lamellar materials." Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 109 (2017): 264-287.
3. Luo, Wen, and Zdeněk P. Bažant. "Fishnet model with order statistics for tail probability of failure of nacreous biomimetic materials with softening interlaminar links." Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids 121 (2018): 281-295.

To run the code, use the file "Fishnet_FEM_Softening_Batch_V2.m" as the main function. The code itself is self-explanatory.
